1. Installing R

You can download and install R from
the Comprehensive R Archive Network (https://cran.r-project.org/)
(also known as CRAN). It is relatively straightforward, 
but if you need further help you can try the following resources: 

* [Installing R on Windows](https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows#installing-r) 
* [Installing R on Mac](http://youtu.be/Icawuhf0Yqo)
* [Installing R on Ubuntu](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README)

2. Installing RStudio

The next step is to install RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/home/), 
a program for viewing and running R scripts. Technically you can 
run all the code in the training without installing RStudio, but we highly 
recommend installing RStudio for the training session. Instructions are here: 
http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and for
Windows we have special instructions (https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows).
